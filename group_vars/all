# The term "serving" is a bit vague but this var is a little overloaded

#
#	This is set here as a variable mostly in the event it would like to be set to
#	something other than the non-default ipv4 address (multiple NICs), or
#	anything similar. We could probably make this rather sophisticated.

# 						at the time of this writing version 2 is most recent.
